# 1 Metric and Normed Spaces
*supermum*: least upper bound

*infimum*: greatest lower bound

**diameter**: diam $A = \sup \{d(x, y)| x, y \in A \}$

**distance**: $d(x, A) = \inf \{d(x, y)| y \in A\}$

**isomorphism(同构)**: a map $l: X \to Y$ which satisfies $d_Y(l(x_1), l(x_2)) = d_X(x_1, x_2)$ for all $x_1, x_2 \in X$ is called an *isometry* or an *isometric embedding* of $X$ into $Y$

**compactness(紧致)**: a subset $K$ of a metric space $X$ is *sequentially compact* if every sequence in $K$ has a convergent subsequence whose limit belongs to $K$

# 2 Continuous Functions
函数序列收敛($f_n \to f$):

**pointwise convergence**: $f_n(x) \to f(x) \quad \forall x\in X$

**metric convergence**: $||f_n-f|| \to 0$

> unlike pointwise convergence, uniform convergence preserves continuity
