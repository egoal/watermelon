> the solution we adopt in this paper is to design approximation algorithms, which are computationally efficient and provide performance guarantees (roughly speaking, produce a set which is not far from the optimal subset).

> we investigate how to speed up computation(or, equivalently, reduce the computational effort) in visual navigation by prioritizing sensor data in a task-dependent fashion.

>  their reliance on having to view all points on the object.

> this type of worlds can be found in a range of video games, including but not limited to 2D isometric games and text console based games like rouge-likes.
